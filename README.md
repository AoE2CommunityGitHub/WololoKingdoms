A program for converting AOE2HD expansions files to the original AOC engine format.

## Why ?
People who are playing AOE2:HD are probably aware of all the issues currently affecting the game : lobbies not starting,
desyncs, restore function not working, lag issues etc.
The original AOC version with UserPatch doesn't suffer from as many issues, and is overall a way stabler and usable version of the engine.
However, people playing on this version of the engine are missing out on great contents provided by the expansions released for AOE2HD.
This program is an (early) attempt at providing the best of both worlds, while waiting for an even better game engine (openage)
